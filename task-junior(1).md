## Objective:

Develop a note-taking web application that supports creating, viewing, updating, and deleting notes.

## Technical Requirements:

### Frontend:

- Use React to build the user interface.
- Use vite for the frontend tooling.
- Implement basic form validation for creating and editing notes.
- Provide visual feedback for CRUD operations.

### Backend:

- Create a RESTful API using Node.js to handle CRUD operations.
- Use Express for the backend.
- Store notes in a Postgres database, with each note containing fields for the title, content, and timestamps.

## Additional Features (optional):

- Implement basic user authentication to manage notes on a personal basis.

## Deliverables:

- Source code for both frontend and backend.
- A README file with setup and run instructions.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality: The application should perform all CRUD operations effectively.
- Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to maintain.
- User Experience: The UI should be intuitive and responsive.

## Notes:

- Usage of FE design systems like Material-UI or Ant Design is encouraged.
- Use of ORM libraries is welcomed to facilitate database management and improve data handling.
- Innovations and improvements to the project are highly encouraged. Please document any such contributions in your README.
